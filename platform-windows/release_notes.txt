QUICKSTART:

To quickly run the system after installed, open the JSON-SCADA desktop folder and:

 * On the JSON-SCADA desktop folder: execute _Start_Services.
 * On the JSON-SCADA desktop folder: execute _JSON SCADA WEB.

The system is preconfigured to connect to a online demo simulation via IEC60870-5-104 protocol with an example point list and screens.
To issue a command, click on a breaker and push the "Command" button then choose 
  an action like "open" or "close" and push the action button.
To edit and create new SVG screens, use the customized Inkscape+SAGE 
  (shortcut in the JSON-SCADA folder). 
Screens are in "c:\json-scada\src\htdocs\svg\".
JSON SCADA configuration files are in "c:\json-scada\conf\".
For more info about configuration please read the documentation.

By default, the system is configured to allow HTTP access only by the local machine.
To allow other IP addresses edit the "c:\json-scada\conf\nginx_access_control.conf" file.
To configure safe remote client access, configure IP address access control, HTTPS, 
  client certificates and user authentication directly in the Nginx configuration files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

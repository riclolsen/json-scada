# Mac Install

I test using a Macbook Air M1 using Rosetta. Install on Intel Macs should also work. 
Native M1 install should be available some time after Homebrew matures for Apple ARM M1 platform.

## Thoughts on Apple ARM M1 platform

{json:scada} is fully portable to platforms where you can run MongoDB, Postgresql, Node.js, Go and Dotnet. So Macs can also be targeted.
I think the M1 will be the perfect platform for running {json:scada} servers and clients for big and small systems.
For local control, the Mac Mini is ideal, it is powerful and power efficient, is has only one fan. It will  be a nice option for harsh environments like substations and power plants.
For control centers the Mac Mini can be a nice and cheap solution for either a {json:scada} server or a client for operators.
  
## Install Homebrew

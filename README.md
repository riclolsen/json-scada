# {json:scada}

![logo](https://github.com/riclolsen/json-scada/raw/master/src/htdocs/images/json-scada.svg "{json:scada} Logo")

A portable and scalable SCADA/IoT platform centered on the MongoDB database server.

## Major features and characteristics
* Standard IT tools applied to SCADA/IoT (MongoDB, PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB,Node.js, C#, Golang, Grafana, etc.).
* MongoDB as the real-time core database, persistence layer, config store, SOE historian.
* Portability and interoperability over Linux, Windows, x86/64, ARM.
* Horizontal scalability, from a single computer to big clusters (MongoDB-sharding), Docker containers, VMs, Kubernetes, cloud, or hybrid deployments.
* Unlimited tags, servers, and users.
* Modular distributed architecture. Lightweight redundant data acquisition nodes can connect securely over TLS to the database server. E.g. a Raspberry PI can be a data acquisition node.
* MongoDB Change Streams for realtime async database events processing.
* HTML5 Web interface. UTF-8/I18N. Mobile access.
* Inkscape-based SVG synoptic display editor.
* IEC60870-5-101/104 client and server protocols. IEC60870-5-104 client with TLS support.
* DNP3 Client (TCP, UDP, Serial and TLS).
* CIP Ethernet/IP PLCTags client driver (experimental).
* PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB historian integrated with Grafana for easy creation of dashboards.
* Extensibility of data model (MongoDB: NoSQL/schema-less).
* Development of custom applications with modern stacks like MEAN/MERN, etc.
* Big data / ML capabilities through MongoDB Spark connector.
* Access to the MongoDB ecosystem of tools, community, services, etc.
* Easy to understand system with small code size for each independent module. Extensive use of JSON from bottom up.
* Possibility of easy integration of new and custom protocol drivers developed with modern programming languages.
* Future-proof, vendor independence, flexibility, extensibility.
* Reduced human costs for maintenance and development thanks to the employment of widely-used open-source IT technologies.
* Live point configuration updates.
* Role-based access control and web-based configuration management (now under development).
* Planned protocol drivers: OPC-UA, DNP3 Server, MODBUS, MQTT.
* Planned integrations: InfluxDB/Telegraf, NodeRed, MS Power BI.

## Use cases
* Power/Oil/Gas/etc Local Station HMI.
* Manufacturing Local HMI.
* SCADA Protocol Gateway.
* SCADA Control Center Full System.
* SCADA/IoT Historian. MS Power BI integration.
* Intranet/Internet HTTPS Gateway - Visualization Server.
* Multilevel Systems Integrator (SCADA/IoT/ERP/MES/PLC).
* Global-Level SCADA Systems Integration/Centralization.
* Extensible Development Platform For Data Acquisition And Processing.
* Data concentrator for Big Data / ML processing.
